# Daily Journal - January 30, 2026

## Key Discussions

### Google Tasks Integration
Mike asked about task management options. After evaluating Google Tasks vs Todoist, we went with **Google Tasks** because:
- Free (no new subscription)
- Already integrated with his Google Calendar
- I can work with it via API

Created 4 task lists:
- 🔌 EverTrade — Family recycling business
- 🏠 Real Estate — REALTOR side business
- 👤 Personal — Personal todos
- ⭐ Stardust — W-2 job

### Jarvis Operating System
Mike defined how he wants me to work:

1. **Morning Brief (8:15am CST)** — Weather, tasks, market data, YouTube trends, overnight accomplishments
2. **Proactive Coder (11pm CST)** — Build things while he sleeps, create PRs, improve business systems
3. **2nd Brain** — This system! A Next.js app showing our shared documents
4. **Afternoon Report (2pm CST)** — Deep-dive research on one helpful topic

### Context
- Mike is returning from NYC today (Friday)
- Flight: LGA → HOU, 2:00 PM ET
- Focus areas: EverTrade growth, R2 certification, marketing automation

## Decisions Made
- Task management: Google Tasks (over Todoist)
- 2nd Brain hosting: GitHub + Vercel (accessible from phone)
- Morning brief time: 8:15am (after Emmy drop-off, before trading)

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Test the morning brief delivery
- Start nightly coder sessions
- Continue R2 certification research
